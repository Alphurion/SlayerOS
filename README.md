# SlayerOS
This OS is meant to replace windows. I am just against Copilot as any, which is why I, in 2024 a University student that only knows c++
& HTML am going to create a Linux system that will be able to emulate the windows system to run EXE files and be just as customizeable
as something like MintOS and runs just as well as Windows itself. Named SlayerOS because it shall Slay the great beast of WindowsOS

I want to make this OS because I am too slow to understand Linux operating systems, and I want to make something that is so 
easily useable that my mom could use it.

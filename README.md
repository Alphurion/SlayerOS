# SlayerOS
This OS is meant to replace windows. I am just against Copilot as any, which is why I, in 2024 a University student that only knows c++
& HTML am going to create a Linux system that will be able to emulate the windows system to run EXE files and be just as customizeable
as something like MintOS and runs just as well as Windows itself.
